# Trump Speech Generator

I fine tuned a GPT2 model on a corpus of Trumps speeches and rallies to see what comes out. To test the model without having to download anything, here's the colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12hw55uGm80ikiq9wLtZ2GsWpRnGUCdXv?usp=sharing

For fine-tuning I used this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/christianlillelund/donald-trumps-rallies

Dataset consists of 35 rallies speech. I used huggingface transformers library for training `train.ipynb`. If you find this interesting, please star the repo.
